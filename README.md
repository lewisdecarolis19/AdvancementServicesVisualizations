<h1>Advancement Services Reporting</h1>

<h2>Background Information 🏞️</h2>

Advancement Services is responsible for entering, maintaining, and retrieving data related to fundraising and donations within a non-profit organization. They provide insights on fundraising data, which includes building donor ratings and scores, predicting revenue and production, and analyzing trends by financial category over time.  Advancement Services also creates financial and constituent reports for internal and external stakeholders related to fundraising. Additionally, they use their findings to research and identify new prospects as well as update information on current prospects and donations. 
<br><br>
In Advancement Services, revenue and production differ. Revenue measures actual cash received, including payments, bequests, irrevocable planned gifts, and pledges. It reflects the amount collected by the fundraising campaign, excluding new activities or expectancies. Production measures new activity or expectancies like outright gifts, bequest expectancies, planned gifts, and pledges, excluding payments. Both metrics gauge performance but from different perspectives.

The following project is an example of the type of reporting an Advancement Services department would be responsible for.

<h2>Objective 🎯</h2>


This project aims to report on the non-profit's current campaign production and revenue. The task involves creating data visualizations for reports shared with both internal and external stakeholders. These visuals should clearly show differences between actual revenue and production versus target numbers, breaking down data by financial category and year. Ultimately, these charts will illustrate fundraising performance and trends, highlighting areas needing improvement to achieve goals. 
<br><br>
A dashboard is being developed to further identify key trends and insights as well as gauge performance in greater detail.  Currently, the included visualizations are meant to act as easily interpreted supplements to written reports, and they are not meant to be drilled down into or sliced further by the user.
